# Code of Conduct

## Our Standard

LOOM is committed to a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone.

We expect contributors to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Assume good intent while giving direct, technical feedback.
- Focus critique on ideas and code, not people.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experience levels.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory language.
- Personal attacks, insults, or trolling.
- Publishing private information without consent.
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Prefer private reporting to maintainers via GitHub Security Advisories, or
- Open a minimal issue requesting a private contact channel.

Please include concrete details (what happened, where, when, and involved accounts) so maintainers can investigate.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning, temporary ban, or permanent removal from project spaces.

Enforcement decisions prioritize community safety and project integrity.
