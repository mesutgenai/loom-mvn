# Support

## Getting Help

- Bug reports: open a GitHub issue using the bug template.
- Feature requests: open a GitHub issue using the feature template.
- Security vulnerabilities: follow `SECURITY.md` and report privately.

## Scope Of Community Support

Support is best-effort for:

- Latest `main` branch (`0.2.x` line).
- Most recent tagged release in `0.2.x`.

Older releases may receive guidance but are not guaranteed security or bug-fix backports.

## Response Targets

- General issues: initial maintainer response target is 5 business days.
- Security issues: see SLA targets in `SECURITY.md`.

## Before Opening An Issue

- Confirm behavior on latest `main` if possible.
- Include environment details (`node -v`, OS, relevant env vars with secrets removed).
- Provide a minimal reproduction.
