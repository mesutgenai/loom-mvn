# Prior Versions Summary — Email Replacement Project

## Version 1: MESH (Message Exchange for Shared Hyperconnectivity)
**Status:** Completed in previous session
**Key Concepts:**
- Acronym: Message Exchange for Shared Hyperconnectivity
- Focused on replacing email with a protocol designed for human-agent collaboration
- Structured message exchange model
- Shared hyperconnectivity as the core metaphor

## Version 2: NEXUS Protocol (Next-generation EXchange for Unified Systems)
**Status:** Completed in previous session — **REJECTED by user (name must NOT be Nexus)**
**Key Concepts:**
- Acronym: Next-generation EXchange for Unified Systems
- Protocol-first approach to email replacement
- Unified systems interoperability
- Agent-native communication design

## Differentiation Requirements for Version 3
1. **Name:** Must NOT be "Nexus" — needs a fresh, distinctive name
2. **Must go beyond** both MESH and NEXUS conceptually — not just a rename
3. **Core problem remains:** Email was designed for humans only; agents need a first-class seat at the table
4. **Key areas to differentiate on:**
   - Deeper treatment of agent identity, trust, and capability negotiation
   - More concrete protocol/addressing mechanics (beyond metaphor)
   - Clearer migration path from existing email infrastructure
   - Richer handling of structured data, tasks, and workflows (not just messages)
   - Emphasis on composability — agents and humans assembling communication flows, not just sending messages
   - Consider: channels, threads, intent-based routing, machine-readable envelopes, capability discovery
5. **Tone:** Should feel like a real protocol/platform spec, not just a vision doc
